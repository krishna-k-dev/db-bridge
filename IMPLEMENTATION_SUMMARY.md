## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

### Available Metrics

#### Connection Pool Metrics

```typescript
{
  totalPools: number,           // Total number of pools
  activePools: number,          // Currently connected pools
  totalConnections: number,     // Total open connections
  poolsByServer: Map<string, number>  // Pools per server
}
```

#### Job Queue Metrics

```typescript
{
  pending: number,              // Jobs waiting in queue
  running: number,              // Currently executing jobs
  completed: number,            // Successfully completed
  failed: number,               // Failed permanently
  totalProcessed: number,       // Total processed
  avgProcessingTime: number     // Average time in ms
}
```

#### Job Progress

```typescript
{
  jobId: string,
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed',
  totalConnections: number,
  completedConnections: number,
  failedConnections: number,
  percentage: number,           // 0-100
  currentStep: string,
  errors: string[],
  connectionProgress: Map<string, ConnectionProgress>
}
```

### How to Access Metrics

From renderer process:

```typescript
const poolMetrics = await ipcRenderer.invoke("get-pool-metrics");
const queueMetrics = await ipcRenderer.invoke("get-queue-metrics");
const jobProgress = await ipcRenderer.invoke("get-job-progress", jobId);
const allProgress = await ipcRenderer.invoke("get-all-progress");
```

## 🎯 Performance Recommendations

### For 70-80 Concurrent Connections

**Recommended Settings:**

```
DB_POOL_MAX=20
MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS=80
JOB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENT=10
```

**Why:**

- Each server can have up to 20 pooled connections
- App can handle up to 80 total concurrent connections
- Queue processes 10 jobs at a time (each job may use multiple connections)

### For 500+ Connections

**Recommended Settings:**

```
DB_POOL_MAX=30
MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS=500
JOB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENT=20
DB_POOL_IDLE_MS=60000
```

**Additional Steps:**

1. Monitor DB server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
2. Ensure DB server max_connections setting is high enough
3. Monitor network bandwidth
4. Use monitoring dashboard to watch queue depth
5. Gradually increase limits while load testing

### DB Server-Side Checks

Run on SQL Server:

```sql
-- Check current session count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions WHERE is_user_process = 1;

-- Check max connections limit
SELECT @@MAX_CONNECTIONS AS MaxConnections;

-- Check wait stats
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC;
```

2. Shows real-time progress as job executes
3. Expands to show per-connection progress
4. Auto-hides when complete (after 5 seconds)
5. Toast notification shows final result

### 2. Background Job Execution

Scheduled jobs run in the background:

1. Queue picks up jobs based on schedule
2. Progress tracked in ProgressStream
3. JobMonitor shows active background jobs
4. Can view detailed progress by expanding

### 3. Monitoring System Health

Navigate to Settings to:

1. View current pool/queue configuration
2. Adjust limits based on performance
3. Enable/disable features

Use IPC handlers to:

1. Get real-time pool metrics
2. Get queue depth and status
3. Monitor active jobs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Connections Timing Out

**Symptoms:** Jobs fail with timeout errors

**Solutions:**

1. Increase `DB_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` in settings
2. Reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS` to avoid overwhelming DB
3. Check DB server load and resources
4. Verify network connectivity

### Issue: Queue Backing Up

**Symptoms:** Jobs stuck in pending state

**Solutions:**

1. Increase `JOB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENT` in settings
2. Check if jobs are failing and retrying
3. Review job execution time - optimize slow queries
4. Check for deadlocks or long-running queries on DB

### Issue: High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:** App using excessive memory

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce `DB_POOL_MAX` - fewer pooled connections
2. Reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS`
3. Check for connection leaks (monitor pool metrics)
4. Ensure jobs are completing (not hanging)

### Issue: Progress Not Updating

**Symptoms:** JobMonitor not showing progress

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure "Enable Real-time Progress Streaming" is ON in settings
2. Check browser console for IPC errors
3. Restart the app
4. Verify main window is loaded and ready
